# Project 1: Switch Configuration


## Scenario

In this activity, I performed basic switch configuration tasks. I secured access to the command line interface, CLI, and console ports using encryption and plain text passwords. I also configured messages for users logging into the switch. These message banners are also used to warn unauthorized users that access is prohibited.


## Completed Objectives

Verify the Default Swwitch Configuration
Configure a Basic Switch Configuration
Configure a MOTD Banner
Save Configurations Files to NVRAM
Configue Switch 2
